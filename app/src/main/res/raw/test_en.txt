Invite them to testify that none has the right to be  worshipped but Allah and that l am His Messenger. If they obey you in  this, then teach them that Allah, the Glorious One, has enjoined five  prayers upon them in every day and night (in twenty-four hours), and if  they obey you in this, then tell them that Allah has made it obligatory  for them to pay Zakah upon their assets and it is to be taken from the  wealthy among them and given to the poor among them.” Related by  Al-Bukhari </item>
        <item>                       Anas (RAA) narrated that Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (RAA)  wrote him this letter, “This is the obligatory Zakah, which the  Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made obligatory for every Muslim, and which  Allah, the Almighty had commanded him to observe. ‘For each twenty-four  camels, or less, their Zakah is to be paid as sheep; for every live  camels, their Zakah is one sheep. When the amount of camels is between  twenty -five to thirty- five, the due Zakah is one she-camel ‘bint  makhad’ (a camel which is one year old and just starting the second  year) or a male camel ‘ibn labun’(a young male camel which is two years  old and already starting the third year). However, when the amount of  camels reaches thirty-six, the due Zakah is a young she-camel 'bint  labun’ (a young female camel, which is two years old and already  starting the third year). When they reach forty six to sixty camels,  their due Zakah is a she camel ‘hiqqah’ (which is three years old and  starting the fourth). When they reach sixty-one to seventy-five, one  ‘Jaz'ah’ (a four year old camel already starting its fifth year). When  their number is between seventy-six to ninety camels, their due Zakah is  two young she camels ‘bint labun’. When they are in the range between  ninety-one to one hundred and twenty camels, the Zakah is two young she  camels 'hiqqah’. If they are over a hundred and twenty camels, on every  forty camels, one 'bint labun’ is due. And for every fifty camels (over  one hundred and twenty) a young she-camel ‘hiqqah’ is due, And anyone,  who has got only four camels, does not have to pay Zakah unless he (the  owner of the camels) wants to give something voluntarily. Regarding the  Zakah of grazing sheep, if they are between forty and one hundred and  twenty, one sheep is due as Zakah. lf they are between 120 and 200, two  sheep are due. If they are between 200 and 300, three sheep are due. If  they exceed three hundred sheep, then one sheep is due for every extra  hundred grazing heads. If the grazing sheep are less than forty, (even  if they are 39) then no Zakah is due on them, unless he (the owner of  the camels) wants to give something voluntarily.  One should not combine (i.e. gather young animals together) or separate  them for fear of paying Zakah. When there is a mixture of cattle shared  between two partners, and Zakah is paid jointly between them, then they  have to calculate it equally among them (depending on the share of  each). Neither an old or a defective animal nor a male goat (a ram used  for breeding) may be taken as Zakah, unless the Zakah collector wishes  to do so. Concerning silver, the Zakah paid is a quarter of a tenth for  each 200 Dirhams. If the amount of silver is less than two hundred  Dirhams (even if it is 190) then no Zakah is to be paid for it, unless  the owner wishes to do so. If the number of camels reaches the number on  which a jaz'ah (a four year old camel already starting its fifth year)  is due as Zakah, but he only has a ‘hiqqah’ (a she camel which is three  years old and starting the fourth), it should be accepted from him along  with two sheep if they were available (to compensate for the  difference) or twenty Dirhams. If on the other hand he has to offer a  ‘hiqqah’ as Zakah, but he only has a jaz'ah, it is accepted from him,  and the Zakah collector will then pay him the difference, which is  twenty Dirhams or two female sheep.’ Related by AI-Bukhari.

When we reached Dhul-Hulaifah, Asma` bint 'Umais gave birth to  Muhammad Ibn Abi Bakr. She sent a message to the Prophet (ﷺ) (asking him  what she should do). He said, "Take a bath, bandage your private parts  and make the intention for Ahram." The Prophet (ﷺ) then prayed in the  mosque and then mounted al-Qaswa (his she-camel) and it stood erect with  him on its back at al-Baida’ (the place where he started his Ihram). He  then started pronouncing the Talbiyuh, saying:                       "Labbaika Allahumma labbaik labbaika la sharika  laka labbaik, innal hamda wan-ni’mata laka wal mulk, la sharika lak (O  Allah! I hasten to You. You have no partner. I hasten to You. All praise  and grace is Yours and all Sovereignty too; You have no partner). When  we came with him to the House (of Allah), he placed his hands on the  Black Stone (Hajar al Aswad) and kis+sed it. He then started to make  seven circuits (round the Ka’bah), doing ramal (trotting) in three of  them and walking (at his normal pace) four other circuits. Then going to  the place of Ibrahim (Maqam Ibrahim), there he prayed two rak'at. He  then returned to the Black Stone (Hajar al Aswad) placed his hands on it  and kissed it. Then he went out of the gate to Safa, and as he  approached it, he recited: “Verily as-Safa and Marwah are among the  signs appointed by Allah,"(2:158), adding, “I begin with what Allah  began." He first mounted as-Safa until he saw the House, and facing the  Qiblah he declared the Oneness of Allah and glorified Him and said: ‘La  ilaha illa-llah wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahul mulk wa lahul hamd, wa  huwa 'ala kulli shai’in qadeer, la ilaha illa-llahu wahdahu anjaza  wa'dahu, wa nas ara 'abdahu, wa hazamal ahzaba wahdah’ (There is no God  but Allah, He is One, and has no partner. His is the dominion, and His  is the praise and He has Power over all things. There is no God but  Allah alone, Who fulfilled His promise, helped His servant and defeated  the confederates alone.") He said these words three times making  supplications in between. He then descended and walked towards Marwah,  and when his feet touched the bottom of the valley, he ran; and when he  began to ascend, he walked (at his normal pace) until he reached Marwah.  There he did as he had done at Safa….  When it was the day of Tarwiyah (8th of Dhul-Hijjah) they went to Mina  and put on the Ihram for Hajj and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) rode his  mount, and there he led the Dhur (noon), ‘Asr (afternoon), Maghrib  (sunset), ‘Isha and Fajr (dawn) prayers. He then waited a little until  the sun had risen, and commanded that a tent be pitched at Namirah  (close to Arafat). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), continued on until he  came to Arafah and he found that the tent had been pitched for him at  Namirah. There he got down until the sun had passed its meridian; he  commanded that al-Qaswa’ be brought and saddled for him, then he came to  the bottom of the valley, and addressed the people with the well-known  sermon Khutbat al-Wada (the Farewell Sermon). Then the Adhan was  pronounced and later on the Iqamah and the Prophet led the Dhuhr (noon)  prayer. Then another Iqamah was pronounced and the Prophet led the Asr  (afternoon) prayer and he observed no other prayer in between the two.  The Messenger of Allah then mounted his camel and came to the place  where he was to stay. He made his she-camel, al-Qaswa turn towards the  rocky side, with the pedestrian path lying in front of him. He faced the  Qiblah, and stood there until the sun set, and the yellow light  diminished somewhat, and the disc of the sun totally disappeared. He  pulled the nose string of al-Qaswa’ so forcefully that its head touched  the saddle (in order to keep her under perfect control), and pointing  with his right hand, advised the people to be moderate (in speed)  saying: “O people! Calmness! Calmness!" Whenever he passed over an  elevated tract of land, he slightly loosened the nose-string of his  camel until she climbed up. This is how he reached al-Muzdalifah. There  he led the Maghrib (sunset) and Isha prayers with one Adhan, and two  lqamas, and did not pray any optional prayers in between them. The  Messenger of Allah then lay down until dawn and then offered the Fajr  (dawn) prayer with an Adhan and an Iqamah when the morning light was  clear. He again mounted al-Qaswa’, and when he came to Al-Mash‘ar  Al-Haram (The Sanctuary Landmark, which is a small mountain at  al-Muzdalifah) he faced the Qiblah, and supplicated to Allah, Glorified  Him, and pronounced His Uniqueness and Oneness, and kept standing until  the daylight was very clear. Then he set off quickly before the sun  rose, until he came to the bottom of the valley of Muhassir where he  urged her (al·Qaswa’) a little. He followed the middle road, which comes  out at the greatest Jamarah (one of the three stoning sites called  Jamrat-ul ‘Aqabah), he came to Jamarah which is near the tree. At this  he threw seven small pebbles, saying, Allahu Akbar` while throwing each  of them in a manner in which small pebbles are thrown (holding them with  his fingers) and this he did while at the bottom of the valley. He then  went to the Place of sacrifice, and sacrificed sixty-three (camels)  with his own hand (he brought 100 camels with him and he asked ’Ali to  sacrifice the rest). The Messenger of Allah again rode and came to the  House (of Allah), where he performed Tawaf al-Ifada and offered the  Dhuhr prayer at Makkah….’ Muslim transmitted this hadith through a very  long narration describing the full details of the Hajj of the Prophet </item>

When you meet your enemy, or the polytheists, invite them  to three courses of action, and accept whichever of them they are  willing to agree to, and withhold from doing anything else:                       Call them to Islam, and if they agree accept it  from them.
